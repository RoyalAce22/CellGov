//! Behaviour (the decrypter pipeline, the PUP unpacker) lives in

//!
//! Per-revision SELF APP keys plus the `SelfKey` struct and the
//! `app_key_for_revision` lookup helper currently live in

//! table is tightly coupled with the const-fn helpers that construct
//! it. Move the standalone scalar keys here so dump-imports and the
//! decrypter share a single declaration.
